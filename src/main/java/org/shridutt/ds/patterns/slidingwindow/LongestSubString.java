 * Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct(different) characters.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: String="araaci", K=2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct(different) characters is "araa".
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: String="araaci", K=1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct(different) characters is "aa".
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct(different) characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi"
